# 🚨 OPERATION — Sequence 97 🚨
> **Mission:** Decode the obfuscated source to identify the NullVector Syndicate's password and deduce the secret password to disable the wipeout drone `Sequence 97`, and 

## Task requirements

1. Decode the provided obfuscated starter file into valid Kotlin so it compiles and runs.
2. Identify the scoring rule inside the code and find a password that makes the program output the two success lines:

   ```
   password accepted, system integrity verified
   bomb defused; the quick brown fox jumps over lazy guard dog
   ```
3. Run the decoded program ([Kotlin Playground](https://play.kotlinlang.org) or locally), capture a screenshot showing the code and the console output with the successful defused message.
4. Prepare a short `password_working.txt` explaining the process (and all guesses successful and unsuccessful) to find the password.

## Submission (files to submit)

* `decoded_source.kt` — your readable, compilable Kotlin source.
* `syndicate-starter.kt` — the original obfuscated starter file (unchanged).
* `playground_screenshot.png` — screenshot showing code and console output.
* `cipher.txt` — character mapping for each emoji to the corrusponding letter of the alphabet.
* `password_working.txt` — brief explanation (1–3 short paragraphs) of how you found the password.
* `successful-password.txt` — your final password
* Optional bonus: `bonus_passwords.txt` — list up to 7 alternative passwords that also work.

Name your submission folder: `SchoolName_TaskForce_1.zip`.

## Brief hint

* Only letters matter — every non-letter character is placed as it is in the `syndicate-starter.kt` Kotlin file.
* Try to look at common structures, boilerplates, or terms used in code (also Kotlin) maybe they can help you crack the code

## Resources

* Kotlin docs / Playground: [https://kotlinlang.org/](https://kotlinlang.org/) (use the Playground to test quickly)

## Bonus (+2 points)

Provide `bonus_passwords.txt` with up to **7 different** passwords that also pass the check. One-line explanation per password is enough.

Good luck, Operative — the NullVector Syndicate won’t wait. 🛡️
